# claude-pdf

A minimalist macOS PDF viewer with an AI side panel — highlight text or screenshot a region and ask questions about it, via your Claude subscription (Claude Code CLI), the Anthropic API, or DeepSeek.

- **Design & implementation plan:** [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)
- **Phase 0 spike results** (subscription CLI path, validated): [docs/phase0-spike.md](docs/phase0-spike.md)
- **Measured PDFKit coordinate behavior** (why crop conversion looks the way it does): [docs/phase2-geometry.md](docs/phase2-geometry.md)

## Building

Requires Xcode 16+ and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`).

```bash
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project ClaudePDF.xcodeproj -scheme ClaudePDF build
xcodebuild -project ClaudePDF.xcodeproj -scheme ClaudePDF -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

Or open `ClaudePDF.xcodeproj` in Xcode after generating. The project file is generated from [project.yml](project.yml) and not checked in.

Tests live in `ClaudePDFTests` and run headlessly — the geometry and rendering sources are compiled into the test bundle rather than tested through a host app, so the run never has to launch the document-based UI.

## Status

Phases 0–2 complete: the viewer scrolls, searches and restores position; text selections (⌘L) and region screenshots (⌘⇧A) both produce anchored questions, rendered against a mock provider. Real providers land in Phases 3–5 — see the phase list in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Asking about the document

- **Text** — select text in the PDF, then ⌘L (or the toolbar's *Ask about Selection*). The snippet appears above the chat input and is attached to your next question.
- **Region** — ⌘⇧A, then drag a rectangle around a figure, table, or equation. Esc or a click cancels. The crop is exported as a 2× PNG (long edge capped at 1600 px) and any text underneath it is captured too, so text-only providers still get something to read.
